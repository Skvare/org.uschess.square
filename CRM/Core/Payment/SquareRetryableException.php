 * Class CRM_Core_Payment_SquareRetryableException.
 *
 * Marks a webhook-processing failure as transient (network error, Square
 * API 5xx, or a prerequisite CiviCRM record that may simply not exist yet)
 * so CRM_Core_Payment_SquareIPN::processQueuedWebhookEvent() can leave the
 * queued event in the "new" state for the mjwshared
 * Job.process_paymentprocessor_webhooks scheduled job to retry, instead of
 * marking it "error" (a dead end — that job only ever re-picks "new" rows).
 *
 * Anything else (malformed payload, permanently unsupported event) should
 * throw a plain CRM_Core_Exception, which is treated as non-retryable.
